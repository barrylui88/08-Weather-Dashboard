# Weather Dashboard

## Description 

This webpage is a dashboard allowing the user to input the name of any city and by clicking return, they are able to see the weather forecast for today as well as the next five days.

The page is built using a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and also uses the jQuery Library for calling the OpenWeatherMap API (using AJAX) and to quickly link the HTML elements to the JavaScript variables.

This task has given me a real appreciation of the attention to detail required when coding. There were several times where I had missed a "#" key and the link to the HTML element would not work, yet the browser does not throw any errors and I would be confused as to why things weren't working. Nonetheless, the webpage is fully functional and I have learned a huge amount through this task.
